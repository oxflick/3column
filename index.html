			<h2>The Importance!</h2>
			<p>Dental disease is an often-overlooked threat to the comfort and health of your pet. Because dental disease often has few readily apparent signs, bringing your pet in for a wellness examination is the only way to ensure detection. </p>
			<p> Dental disease is the most common disease seen by veterinarians: 70-85% of pets over the age of 2 have some form of dental disease. </p>
			<p> It is important to have your pet checked for dental disease, as this disease can have major impacts on your pet’s organs, including the heart, liver, and kidneys. </p>
